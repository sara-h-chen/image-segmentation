If there was a way to get a plain background then we could have done a background subtraction, but the downside would then be that the background should remain the same for all the images; but because this is not the case, there would be slight differences in each of the images.

Tried Laplacian, but Laplacian returns too much noise from the gradient, which then becomes indistinguishable

Contouring was ineffective

Tried various filters, including CLAHE but increasing the contrast affected the background, creating more noise or entire patches of missing information

Using CLOSE transformation, i.e. dilation would have made non-connected components now connected.
